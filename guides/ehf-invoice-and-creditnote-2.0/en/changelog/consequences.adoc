= Consequences of Implementing this version

Version 2.0.6 is a revision of EHF 2.0, and this version is backwards compatible to EHF 2.0. This means that any instance documents valid towards EHF 2.0 is also valid in version 2.0.6. Please note that valid here reflects the validity against the implementation guide of EHF 2.0, as this is the normative reference.


== Registration in ELMA

Invoice and creditnote receivers capable of receiving EHF 2.0 instance documents is also capable of receiving EHF 2.0.6, so no change is needed in the registration in ELMA.
