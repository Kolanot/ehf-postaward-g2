= Product identification

Product identification may be done using the identifiers described below:

* Sellers ID
* Standard ID, e.g. the GS1 Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) [GS1]

The order agreement requires that an item has an identifier. This can be either the sellers idenfier or a standard identifier. Which identifier to use depends on what is known at the time of the purchase or what is commonly used in the relevant business sector.
