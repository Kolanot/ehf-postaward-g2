= Process flow

The order agreement process flow can be described as follows:

Start position.

. A Buyer makes a purchase of goods or services from the Seller.
.	A Seller reports one or more accumulated purchases made under a framework agreement to the Buyer.

End positions.

.	A purchase has been recorded in the Buyer´s purchasing system. The seller proceeds to invoice accordingly.

An Order Agreement may refer to a framework agreement for its terms and conditions; otherwise the Buyer’s terms and conditions apply.
