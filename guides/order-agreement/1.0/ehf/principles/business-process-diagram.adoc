= Process flow

The order agreement process flow can be described as follows:

Start position.

. A Buyer makes a purchase of goods or services from the Seller.
.	A Seller reports one or more accumulated purchases made under a framework agreement to the Buyer.

End positions.

.	A purchase has been recorded in the Buyer´s purchasing system. The seller proceeds to invoice accordingly.

An Order Agreement may refer to a framework agreement for its terms and conditions; otherwise the Buyer’s terms and conditions apply.

| Categories | Description and Values

| Description | The buyer doesn’t use the purchasing system to create an order. It’s done outside of this system.

The seller creates an order in his ordering system based on requirements from the buyer and, after agreeing/committing to it, sends a copy of the order as an Order agreement to the buyer.

| Pre-conditions | The seller’s ordering system must be able to send Order agreement transactions.

The buyer’s purchasing system must be able to receive Order agreement transactions.

The content of the order is agreed through use of web shop, phone, email, physical visit to shop or other means.

| Post-conditions | The buyer has received an order agreement that is recorded in the purchasing system.

| Legal Implications | By providing an Order agreement transaction the Seller commits himself the, quantities, prices and terms stated in the Order agreement transaction.
