= Process flow

The Punch Out process flow can be described as follows:

The Buyer is “re-directed” from his procurement system to the seller’s Punch Out enabled website. The buyer searches the website.

At the website the buyer search and select articles which are added to a shopping cart.
When the buyer checks out of the website, a transaction (Punch Out) with item information of the selected item is sent to the buyer’s procurement system.
