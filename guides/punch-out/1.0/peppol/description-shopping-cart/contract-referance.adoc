= Contract reference
An individual line may reference a contract. Different lines may reference different contracts. If a contract is referenced on the cart level that contract applies to all items in the shopping cart and is only superseded by the line reference where there is a conflict. As example, if a cart level contract reference give payment terms and the line level contrac only states delivery conditions for the item then the payment terms apply as well. An example of line level contract reference is as follows. "Contracted item indicator", should be used  when shopping from sellers webshop under framework agreements.
