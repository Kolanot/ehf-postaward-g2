=	Principles and prerequisites

This chapter describes the principles and assumptions that underlie the use of PEPPOL  Punch out.   It is based on the CENBII 18 Punch out.  See [CENBII].

This document identifies, explains and justifies the business requirements for the Punch Out-process.  It provides syntax bindings to OASIS UBL 2.1. It also includes a syntax implementation guide.

The Punch Out BIS describes a process where the buyer accesses the seller’s web-based catalogue, and adds and/or configures items (such as a PC) to a product or service list. The product- or service lists are sent to the buyer´s procurement system, and can later be used as a basis for an order or an item comparison in the buyer’s catalogue tool.  The order is prepared and sent from the buyers´s procurement system, not from the seller´s website.
