= Ordering process

The Ordering process descibed in this guide is a common process in most trading businesses. We expect companies to understand this process even if they may have organised it differently.

The Ordering process is as follows:
. A Buyer sends an order to a Seller specifying goods or services to be delivered. The goods or services can either be identified through article numbers or descibed as free text.
. The order may refer to a Commercial agreement stating terms and regulations for the purchase. If not these terms can be specified in the order.
. The Seller receives and vaildates the order message. If the message is not according to agreed format the Seller must inform the Buyer that it will not be processed.
. If validation is OK the Seller processes the order and sends an order response to the Buyer with the result of the processing.
.. The order is accepted completely with a positive order reponse and delivery  will be fulfilled according to agreed terms.
.. The order is accepted with changes on one or more order lines. Further processing should be described in the Collaboration agreement but could potentially lead to some manual handling.
.. The order is rejected completely with a negativ order response and no delivery can be expected.
. When receiving a negative order response rejecting the whole order, the Buyer may initiate a new purchase taking into account the reason for the rejection.

The figure below describes the ordering process using EHF Order messages. The process is based on Profile CENBII 28 - Ordering. This profile assumes that both the Order and the Order Response is sent electronically.

Feedback on reception of the EHF Order and EHF Order Response can be done via e-mail, Telephone or as an electronic message. The use of an electronic message is descibed in chapter 3.4 in this document.

The use of Message Level Response must be agreed between Buyer and Seller.
