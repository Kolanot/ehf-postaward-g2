= Description of Selected Parts

There are no formal requirements to order content according to Norwegian regulations. The content requirements are therefore based on the following:

* Information content in the existing Procurement Platform (EPP)
* UBL 2.1
* CEN BII2

The format will also be verified against requirements in certain areas of the Norwegian private sector.

Chapter 6.1 and 6.2 describe selected areas of the format and specifically information elements being important for use in the Norwegian market.
Part of the content of chapter 6.1 is relevant for both messages while chapter 6.2 contains information relevant only for Order Response.

Complete Information content is defined in chapter 7.
