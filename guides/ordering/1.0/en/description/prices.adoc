= Prices

Prices may be exchanged in the Ordering process both for Catalogue-orders and free text orders. This also allows for the Supplier to change the price in the Order response.

If prices are not sent in the order the normal process is to do price matching during the billing process comparing prices in the Invoice to prices in the Catalogue.

Price sent in EHF Order is related to the articles or services within this order. The following price can be stated:

* Net price including all allowances and charges but excluded Vat

Be aware that Gross prices cannot be sent in the format (price before discount and charges).

Price must have Currency as an attribute. Currency shall be according to Code list.
