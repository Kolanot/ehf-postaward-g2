= Related Products and Accessories

Products can be related to each other for ordering or logistic purposes.  All related products must also be sent as separate Catalogue lines.

Types of relations:

* Products that are bundled and ordered/invoiced together, e.g. bottles and desposits.
* Products that are connected in a product line or a logistics structure, e.g. consumer units and trading units of the same article.
* Accessories that might be sold together with a product, e.g. disk station to a laptop.
