= Description of Selected Parts

There are no formal requirements to catalogue content according to Norwegian regulations. The content requirements are therefore based on the following:

* Information content in the existing Procurement Platform (EPP)
* UBL 2.1
* CEN BII2
* Peppol BIS 1A catalogue

The format will also be verified against requirements in certain areas of the Norwegian private sector.

The following chapters describe selected areas of the format and specifically information elements being important for use in the Norwegian market.
