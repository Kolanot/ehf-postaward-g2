= Action Code

The Action code holds instructions about the treatment of the Catalogue by the recipients system. The Action code can be stated either on header or line level.

It is strongly recommended only to use Action code on header level.

Use of Action codes on line level must be explicitly agreed between sender and receiver.

.Guidelines for use
* Action code must be sent on either header or line level. If Action code is not sent the Catalogue message will be rejected.
* Action code sent on header level will overrule possible Action codes sent on line level.
* If Action code is not sent on header level it is mandatory to send Action codes on all catalogue lines.
* Legal values for Action Code are Add, Replace, Update or Delete.
