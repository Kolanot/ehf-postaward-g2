= Catalogue Process

The Catalogue exchange is the first part of the post-award process and can be described as follows:

. The Catalogue provider (Supplier) collects information about products or services and transforms these into a Catalogue format. This can either be a complete Catalogue or a Catalogue containing selected articles with changes.
. The Catalogue is sent to the Catalogue receiver (Buyer) either directly or via a third party.
. The Catalogue receiver controls if the Catalogue is syntactically correct and contains sufficient information.
. If the Catalogue is accepted, the Catalogue receiver sends a positive Catalogue Response to the Catalogue provider. The Catalogue is now approved for ordering purposes.
. If the Catalogue is rejected, the Catalogue receiver sends a negative Catalogue Response to the Catalogue provider with an explanation to the rejection. The Catalogue provider will make corrections to the Catalogue and resend it.
