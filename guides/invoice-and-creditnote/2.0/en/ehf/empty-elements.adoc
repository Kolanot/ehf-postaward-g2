= Empty Elements

The use of empty elements is prohibited in UBL, which is the base for EHF. The reason for this, is that empty elements may be interpreted to have a certain meaning, it could mean that the information was not available at the time of sending as an example. In addition, numeric- and date elements have requirements that would generate validation errors if they were empty.

IMPORTANT: The use of empty elements is, for the above mentioned reasons, not allowed in EHF.
