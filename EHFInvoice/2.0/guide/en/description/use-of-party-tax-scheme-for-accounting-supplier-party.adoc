PartyTaxScheme under AccountingSupplierParty is an optional  element, but according to EU COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2001/115/ the PartyTaxScheme must be specified if the invoice or the credit note have a VAT total. That means that the element almost always has to be specified. The specification should be the supplier partyâ€™s organization number followed by the letters MVA, like this:
