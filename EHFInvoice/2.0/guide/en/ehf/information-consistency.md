## Information Consistency

The different EHF formats mentioned above contain a number of common information elements (supplier, customer, item etc.). It is important to preserve consistency in those common information elements, and that means that elements with identical content are declared in the same way and as far as possible given the same element tag name.

EHF invoicing formats will for instance re-use elements from the Catalogue and Order to ensure consistency between the messages and to make sure that the information from the business transactions are reflected in the invoicing documents. This makes it possible to implement an efficient and automated control of the invoice and the originating transactions.
