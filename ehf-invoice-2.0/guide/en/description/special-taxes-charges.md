# Special Taxes/Charges

If special taxes/charges are applicable, each one must be specified on an ordinary invoice line. The only valid tax scheme identifier is «VAT» (code list UN/ECE 5153 subset). If there is no separate line for special tax, the assumption is that the special tax is included in the price.
